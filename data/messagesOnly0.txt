Install in progress... Blurb B-sides: Guts Coming and Going explores the potential for aggregate monsters at the edge of the world wide web. As a trillion self published transmissions make their way across the social networks, little nodes siphon the data to big daddy data banks (BDDB). Though you deposit you can never withdraw. The network never forgets, and now, neither do you. Eternal sunshine of the dumbass hive mind, S.O.S. I feel bad, what about you? Between 2011 and 2016 I posted over 2,000 status updates to facebook.com, my top four most used words read: JUST LIKE NEW TIME. Just like new time I wish there was another chance, to reel my guts back into my body. Tell the network ‚Äúforget this‚Äù, and ‚Äúforget that‚Äù. But I‚Äôm inside-out now, and a monster is lurking.

I should very much like to talk to you, to stare at the tip of your nose, to embrace you. But to communicate ‚Äì for that I have no desire." ‚Äî Ivan Illich in an interview (as quoted in ‚ÄòAgainst Global Communication‚Äô by Dougald Hine originally published in Dark Mountain Blog). (via mythic-substrata)
Tom Friedman has described a pivotal point in which he cleared out his studio, boarded up all windows, painted everything white and brought into this clear white emptiness a series of mundane everyday objects from home, contemplated them and began to ask himself a series of questions about them starting with ‚ÄúA) Object‚Ä¶‚Äù. This is that full text.

First woman... I was especially struck by the story of a woman older than her right to vote, pledging delegates for Clinton. Regardless of where and how you are walking party lines, the "first woman" part is exhilarating and something to be excited about.

"...recent research suggests that Duchamp was not actually the source of ‚ÄòFountain‚Äô. Instead, it is now being credited to the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (n√©e Pl√∂tz), the subject of an unfinished biography by Djuna Barnes. The baroness was a performance artiste, a multisexual kleptomaniac and scatologist in whose cheerfully obscene poetry we find coinages such as ‚ÄòPhalluspistol‚Äô and ‚ÄòKissambushed‚Äô."
uh, well, i'll stick with planting and watering myself. but i like it.
"(These) Caterpillars pupate into chrysalises, remaining in this state for up to several years before emerging as butterflies. While inside, their bodies liquefy and reform as completely new creatures." ... "The flourishing of local species is largely driven by restoring native habitats. Planting native flora host plants is an effective way to boost endemic butterfly populations. Weeding (to allow easier access to food sources) and avoiding pesticides is equally beneficial.

"Improving habitat for native fauna is something anyone can do," Wong says. "Conservation and stewardship can start in your very own backyard."

"Performers pass through ever-morphing states of physical entanglement and madcap scenes of distorted familiarity, with Driscoll‚Äôs choreography building new bodies, new stories, new ways of reimagining group experience. Staged in the round, the work presents a heightened sense of observation, invitation, and interdependence that is a joy to join in as it unfolds around you."
apparently in 10 years i make less sense than i do now. AMEN!
‚ÄúWhen I suddenly see myself in the depths of the mirror, I take fright. I can scarcely believe that I have limits, that I am outlined and defined. I feel myself to be dispersed in the atmosphere, thinking inside other creatures, living inside things beyond myself. When I suddenly see myself in the mirror, I am not startled because I find myself ugly or beautiful. I discover, in fact, that I possess another quality. When I haven't looked at myself for some time, I almost forget that I am human, I tend to forget my past, and I find myself with the same deliverance from purpose and conscience as something that is barely alive. I am also surprised to find as I gaze into the pale mirror with open eyes that there is so much in me beyond what is known, so much that remains ever silent.‚Äù

I had a really proud/happy moment when I walked into the undergrad juried exhibition to see two of my old video-students had won awards for work they made in my class. I can't wait to see how new media-robo class projects turn out, people are cranking on some really cool stuff with really hard tech, and learning so much - and i'm learning too. I'm lucky to be a part of it, even if it is as 8am, which has been torture for everyone. 4 weeks and counting ... but hopefully still teaching in the future.

Thank you Andrew Ina(!!!!!!) for such a *beautiful* video documenting the development of my MFA thesis work, Entanglement Is A Virtue [https://vimeo.com/156710001]. I am so lucky to be the subject of one of his short docs [see more https://vimeo.com/andrewina]. In the video you will also see my main advisor Amy Youngs helping me make sense of things.

The project is currently installed in the MFA thesis show notitleanytitle* through March 19th. Let me know if you want to see the work, as I have to be present to guide you through the experience (about 7 minutes). I am meeting some people out there this afternoon and again on Saturday, (11-2pm is booked, but anytime after that). LMK; also know, it will be installed in my studio after the show.

>> I have high stakes in reclaiming vision from the technopornographers, those theorists of minds, bodies, and planets who insist that technology is the sense made to realize the fantasies of the phallocrats. So, how appropriate this video begins with me clicking/surfing/buying around in the belly of the local/global monster in which I am gestating, (often called the postmodern world), where global technology appears to denature everything, to make everything a malleable matter of strategic decisions and mobile production and reproduction processes. A place where I hope my work produces not effects of distance, but effects of connection, of embodiment, and of responsibility for an imagined elsewhere that we may yet learn to see and build here.

bernie just halted his speech in tulsa to get the room quiet while a medic is attending to someone. Brad you okay?
I had some explaining to do. Christie Whisman / nice tunic Maria :)
Chris turned on the lights then kicked us out... I would have run the project all night. Hugging Katie, or something.
I'm into it while still making sense of it... I think that's fair.
Remember that one time I locked myself out of my studio week of thesis install and I was totally running behind and panicking and then Axel VÃõjÃ≤Ã†ÕàÃòÕìÃ≥ÕÖ ÕçÃ£ÕïÃÄAÕöÕ°xÃñÃ§Ã≠ÃªÃ∞xÃ†Ã©ÕìÃô and some holes at the ceiling saved me from total demise? Yup.

The Internet‚Äôs Own Boy and a card game on Periscope. Internet Art class takes the form of the Internet, multiple tabs/windows/data streams, and maps it onto our activities to see how it makes or breaks our capacity for learning and exchange.

Found an Isabella Tiger Moth caterpillar in my basement studio... maybe it came to hang out with the Leopard Moth caterpillar overwintering here.

Take a one-of-a-kind trip with The Strange Eyes of Dr. Myes, the first feature from acclaimed animator Nancy Andrews. The campy, neo-underground cult movie combines live action and animation, as well as tropes from sci-fi, horror films, and Hollywood musicals, to tell the story of a rogue researcher attempting to graft animal senses onto her own. After a near-death experience, she alienates herself from the medical field with revolutionary attempts to expand human consciousness.

#NowPlaying "Carousel Ride" by Rubblebucket from Survival Sounds
Alexander Sawchuk estimates that it was in June or July of 1973 when he, then an assistant professor of electrical engineering at the University of Southern California Signal and Image Processing Institute (SIPI), along with a graduate student and the SIPI lab manager, was hurriedly searching the lab for a good image to scan for a colleague's conference paper. They got tired of their stock of usual test images, dull stuff dating back to television standards work in the early 1960s. They wanted something glossy to ensure good output dynamic range, and they wanted a human face. Just then, somebody happened to walk in with a recent issue of Playboy.

Oklahoma born and bred: Chelsea Manning, the Guardian columnist and whistleblower responsible for one of WikiLeaks most important releases, has been in jail for five years facing an unjust 35 year sentence for exposing some of the U.S. governments worst abuses.

Now, Chelsea is being threatened with indefinite solitary confinement, and the "charges" against her demonstrate that her basic human rights are being violated. Chelsea requested that her hearing be made open to the public, but officials refused.

Chelsea's alleged "crimes" include: sweeping some food onto the floor and then asking to speak to her lawyer when a guard confronted her, having books and magazines in her cell about politics and LGBTQ issues including the Vanity Fair issue with Caitlyn Jenner on the cover, and "improper medicine use" for having a tube of toothpaste that was past its expiration date.

It couldn't be more blatant: Chelsea is being singled out and punished for speaking out.

Chelsea is a human being. She did something brave and now the government is punishing her for it. It's not just Chelsea's basic rights that are at stake, it's all of ours. Please sign the petition, and then share it on social media. This couldn't be more urgent; the hearing is just days away. If it's not open to the public and the press, there will be no way to ensure that Chelsea isn't unfairly subjected to one of the worst forms of psychological torture.

One week in and first Max/MSP patch based program is running well (at least as far as I can tell!! I'm sure installation will prove bugs abound). Found max to be quite finicky, but overall pretty impressive video capabilities. Doing a couple things here, 0) playing a video stream, 1) listening for incoming data from Processing about brainwaves from OpenBCI, 2) doing some fancy stuff to decide if brainwave frequencies from two different people having been similar over time, 3) recording audio/video from video stream if participant's brainwaves are matching, 4) playing back a new video mashup from newly generated clips.

First week in Spokane is wrapping up. Happy to say I am porting brainwave data into Max/MSP no problem, and with hardly any lag. Mixed up a patch today to update camera blur on the fly according to wave readings, (my computer is keeping up at about 18fps). Attached is a screen shot of it in action, kind of little action to be seen though. ... Scheming up the work I will make with this. >> Also, loving Spokane. It is a really wonderful city!

Tada! üîåüìπ‚è≥
One year ago Beau asked if I could put together some "video booth" guts. Then randomly, The Page Collective asked me to do the same a couple days ago. Lucky for TPC I had already tried all the hard ways for Beau (i.e. raspberry pi [fail]) .... sooooo... just rigged this up. Now to transfer it onto some PCB board cause this breadboard situation is pretty bad.
Woohoo! Just booked my airplane ticket to Spokane, WA - headed there for the month of June to work on Biofeedback Cinema at the Laboratory Residency. Washington friends, maybe I finally visit u!
any tips for getting the best deal on rental cars?

Worms and immortality... Happening now...
Caterpillar transformed to chrysalis today, so I tested my question: Can I measure changes in electrical activity inside of the chrysalis using OpenBCI? Turns out I can! So, I connected the *chrysalis & myself* to a robot arm ... when I enter a state of concentration with my eyes closed I produce alpha waves and the robot arm moves to the right. If/when the chrysalis exhibits similar wavelengths the arm moves left. It actually worked! At seemingly random times, (and without any interference with the chrysalis), the chrysalis would produce wavelengths akin to alpha waves, thus triggering the motion of the robot arm to the left. 

At one point nothing was happening for awhile so I leaned in and asked the chrysalis "what are you thinking?" Just at that moment its wavelengths triggered the motion of the robot arm... [w/lilli as my witness]

see video: https://youtu.be/pui5MbiKYeA

Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Chthulucene: Staying with the Trouble
by Donna Haraway

Sympoiesis, not autopoiesis, threads the string figure game played by Terran critters. Always many-stranded, SF is spun from science fact, speculative fabulation, science fiction, and, in French, soin de ficelles (care of/for the threads). The sciences of the mid-20th-century ‚Äúnew evolutionary synthesis‚Äù shaped approaches to human-induced mass extinctions and reworldings later named the Anthropocene. Rooted in units and relations, especially competitive relations, these sciences have a hard time with three key biological domains: embryology and development, symbiosis and collaborative entanglements, and the vast worlds of microbes. Approaches tuned to ‚Äúmulti-species becoming with‚Äù better sustain us in staying with the trouble on Terra. An emerging ‚Äúnew new synthesis‚Äù in trans-disciplinary biologies and arts proposes string figures tying together human and nonhuman ecologies, evolution, development, history, technology, and more. Corals, microbes, robotic and fleshly geese, artists, and scientists are the dramatis personae in this talk‚Äôs SF game.

‚ÄúImperial ideas transform time into space. Nomadic ideas, on the other hand, tend to understand time as a multiplicity of times. These times‚Äîtribes of monads‚Äîare autonomous from each other, each one obeying its own laws. (The notion of a single spatialized time is linked to the historical appearance of the State.) The Rar√°muri, for example, developed a model based on the existence of more than one internal time, sustaining the existence of various ‚Äúsouls‚Äù that simultaneously co-existed within the human body. While the Huichol believe that when a pair of nomad groups meet two different times collide. This understanding of time not only functions to plumb the profound nature of the human animal but also to impede the formation of a unitary political order, a system of centralized control.‚Äù

"In VIVE L'AMOUR, a woman is walking through a park under construction in Taipei. Five years after seeing the film, I went to Taipei myself to see that park and to walk that lane. It started to rain. And the rain became so strong that I had to stay one hour under a kind of shelter. A prisoner in the park, I finally could connect the film and the space in an intense way" (Gonzalez-Foerster, http://www.dgf5.com) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY4Nv8KKrj4

Summer 2014 can't go wrong.
Anyone in Tulsa interested in partaking in an unsolicited public art project at Hunter Park? There is a big pile of logs prime for reorganization. I don't think we'd get arrested.

Oklahoma Arts Institute at Quartz Mountain has one week to raise funding for their film equipment this summer! All gifts will be matched by Continental Resources, so your gift has double the impact. Pass it on!

Caught in the rain, no prob, just stretch. Also, dad likes cycling more than running because it's more dangerous.

Alana Thomas and I have work installed till Friday @ Hopkins Hall Gallery. Come check it out, and share an orange with some butterflies.
If you or anyone you know can teach these college courses, openings in China and Taiwan for a month long teaching gig this Summer. Message me for more info:
I will be in Los Angeles July 3rd through 4th - I hope to find a free couch to crash on for 1 night, indoors preferably. Message me if you know of any accommodations I might pursue.

Are you kidding me?
Studio picnic with Alana Thomas - planning our Hopkins hall show install next week! Reception is one week from today, Thursday, May 8 @ 3 - 4pm.
Do you think he's lost, waiting for micro center to open, or listening to his echo?
It is finished. The (only) 12 page paper from hell. And so marks the end my first year. So now, I will go dance all night with a bottle in my hand... :D
I started cooking from scratch for the first time in my life this year, what HAVE I been eating? Who knows ... anyways, great find from Lisa. How to eat well for $4/day.
Hey, the first year is over! When did that happen?!
Moving stuff around.
Bill (Katrina Mineo) despises Facebook, so he will hate me for posting this, BUT his advice on font choice is pretty hilarious and should be shared, "I prefer Robert Slimbach's Minion Pro for its contemporary handling of timeless Rennaissance models. The small caps does wonders for one's GPA as a section header, while for a few pence extra the Display font can really make the over-18pt title page sing.

Other, more quotidian choices, include Baskerville, which I find a bit stuffy, and Clarendon, good for the history of art dept. Avoid Times and Times New Roman at all costs, as they were developed for reproduction of text on newsprint at small point sizes, forcing elegant serifed feet into the typographic equivalent of galoshes.

If one must tilt to such common fonts, then Garamond is the preferred choice."

Columbus friends: subleasing my room in a luxurious (furnished) 2 bedroom apartment for the Summer months. Message if interested, only $310 plus utilities, nonsmoking females only.
Instead of Coumbus, OH it should be called Tow Away Zone, OH.
On the other side of the trash...
Anyone in Columbus have a truck I can borrow for an hour this week sometime?
Point taken. These are pasted on every bulletin board surface, everywhere, ever.

Spaceship chrysalis in progress:
HOW TO MAKE SOMETHING: "Dear Jenny: The way to do a piece of writing is three or four times over, never once. For me, the hardest part comes first, getting something-anything-out in front of me. Sometimes in a nervous frenzy I just fling words as if l were flinging mud at
a wall. Blurt out, heave out, babble out
something-anything-as a first draft.
With that, you have achieved a sort of
nucleus. Then, as you work it over and
alter it, you begin to shape sentences
that score higher with the ear and eye.
Edit it again-top to bottom. The
chances are that about now you'll be seeing
something that you are sort of eager
for others to see. And all that takes time.
What I have left out is the interstitial
time. You finish that first awful blurting,
and then you put the thing aside.
You get in your car and drive home. On
the way, your mind is still knitting at the
words. You think of a better way to say
something, a good phrase to correct a
certain problem. Without the drafted
version-if it did not exist-you obviously
would not be thinking of things
that would improve it. In  short, you may
be actually writing only two or three
hours a day, but your mind, in one way
or another, is working on it twenty-four
hours a day-yes, while you sleep-but
only if some sort of draft or earlier version
already exists. Until it exists, writing
has not really begun." - John McPhee
"What draws people to #MH370, prompting a Twitter explosion, is that a lost plane runs counter to our contemporary understanding of the world.  If technology has achieved anything, we believe, it‚Äôs that we know how to find airplanes and the bodies riding in them."

who is the artist that queues a bunch of windows and then opens them up one by one creating a beautiful cascade of colors?
Most days i'm pretty sad, missing oklahoma and all that crap, BUT, most days i'm pretty grateful I get to be here too. I might just be making yet another mistake, but i am going balls to the wall via 4th floor install. Literally, tons of translucent paper balls in the making.
It is an eating pizza and folding paper kind day- gonna try to make 4th floor project space my own for a couple weeks.
of course, the radio lab titled "black box" ends with a count of the chrysalis.
I was apathetic about the olympics, but then this came up‚Ä¶ "The portraits, showing Mr. Putin shirtless and riding a variety of mammals, adorn the walls of virtually every hotel room constructed especially for the Olympics and were created at a cost of over two million dollars, Olympic officials said." ‚Ä¶ For his part, President Putin has been dismissive of the complaints, today calling the hotel guests ‚Äúbabies who cry."
Food for thought... "3-D printing could be a revolution in the making ‚Äì but it‚Äôs not there yet. A lot more work needs to be done on its ecological profile so that it truly ruptures the conventions of industrial practices ‚Äì and to do this, it must first urgently tackle the weighty issue of 21st-century materiality."

Pretty weird when 45F feels good.
Go like my friend's drawing, she is working her way through round II to win a competition to finish it as a 100ft mural.
Pretty sweet stuff.
Go LIKE this drawing by my friend Maria K. DiFranco, and help her win the mini-mural competition!
Cool.

"Utah has reduced its rate of chronic homelessness by 78 percent over the past eight years, moving 2000 people off the street and putting the state on track to eradicate homelessness altogether by 2015. How‚Äôd they do it? The state is giving away apartments, no strings attached. In 2005, Utah calculated the annual cost of E.R. visits and jail stays for an average homeless person was $16,670, while the cost of providing an apartment and social worker would be $11,000. Each participant works with a caseworker to become self-sufficient, but if they fail, they still get to keep their apartment."
Noah's smiling cause he just placed 5th chair in the All State Wind Ensemble, and he is just a sophomore! Amazing work Noah!
Facebook has this thing where you can look at your life in 2013 "in review". If I wanted my life to flash before my life I would go sky diving or something.
a terrifying development.
FINALLY got to see Noah perform, he's 1st chair clarinet in BA wind ensemble, and he killed it!

Can someone explain to me why everyone is running around in their underwear, why there are cops EVERYWHERE, and why every house is blasting music really loud? Did I miss something?
I guess snow is a normal thing now, weird.
This is the quietist spot in the apartment. Don't mind the windows vibrating! That's just our neighbors, they party like this all the time, sometimes till 4am, ignore complaints, etc. It's awesome.
Hehe
a couple painted lady butterflies emerged this morning, i sped the video up 5x, check it out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcuj_pcZAiU&feature=youtu.be
Brother Caleb Bagley is in a skate film, showing tomorrow night at Tulsa Event Center. Tickets $10 a pop, check it out! 
This time I got a usb microscope on pending butterfly... I think it will emerge overnight. Watch it live! :D http://jessicaann.info/studiorat/ *the rounder shape near the bottom of the chrysalis is its eyeball.
Well, all my projects are a flop. BUT, I got this "animated" nightlight for .90 today, so I am going to go ahead and say this semester was a success!

I predict the chrysalis in view will be a butterfly by morning. Watch it live! http://jessicaann.info/studiorat

OSU MFAs... please take Approaching Systems with diana, bill, blake, trademark, andrew, and me! - it is a grad seminar with Shane, should be awesome. I talked to Shane today, and he said it will not be "art and techy", soooo...yea. I told him I would get the word out that the class will be awesome. So, that's what this post is:

Finally found a tasty veggie banh mi in Columbus
Overnight this caterpillar escaped, found my planner a suitable spot to start her transformation.
Amazing, never seen this before! A few cremaster hooks RETRACTED. This is long after the caterpillar transformed to chrysalis. I'm gonna find a butterfly expert and ask about this. It happens at the 7-8 second mark.
Got a new car tire today, and installed a candy capture system. Yea, it's a hose and another candy jar. Don't act like you're not impressed. Http://jessicaann.info/studiorat

Welp, feeling guilty about not being in your studio takes on a whole new meaning when everyone can see, you are not in your studio. :/
Up and running with a different streaming service, lag time is 10x less. Crappier quality video, but at least you can almost immediately see the camera pan after
